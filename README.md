Pressure Retarded Osmosis - Techno-economic model

This excel model focuses on the economic parameters for pressure retarded osmosis; the user can input the membrane permeability and other process parameters for their specific application.

There are 24 inputs to the model, in two categories: I. Key process variables (6) II. General inputs (18)

The key process variables include: a. DS salinity, operating pressure and % dilution b. FS salinity, influent flow and % volume reduction
